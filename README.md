## Course Evaluation
* Overall, the probability part of the course is interesting and I got to consolidate my foundations better.
* The random signal/process parts were a bit dry. Lots of memorizing and using the formula.
* Overall, I'll give this course a 2.5/5.


## Reference
* The notes were during the Fall Quarter of 2023 while taking **Professor Khaled Abdel-Ghaffar**'s EEC260 class. View more about the course information on this page: [https://ece.ucdavis.edu/course-catalog](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/course-catalog)
